# PMProj3

This is my repo that satisfies the requirements for Project 3. I use SQL to query a European Soccer Database to look at the tables within the database, the countries represented, English Premier League Games during the 2008/2009 season, matches for Middlesbrough during the 2008/2009 season, and total goals scored for Middlebrough during the 2008/2009 season. Cheers.
